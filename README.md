2. Make сhanges you need
3. Then you have two ways to commit ("git add ." - commit all files with one commit or "git add <file path>" to commit each file separately)
   Personally, I prefer to comment on each file separately, so I will show it way
4. Add your changes :
    1. "git status" to track modified files
